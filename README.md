# How it Works

> I have a secret I can't keep holding, but I can't tell anyone I know!

Great! Sign in and you'll be taken to our "confess" page, where you can create your own Spurr to send away!

> Where does it go?

Your Spurr will be sent to one separate user to enjoy! Only one person sees any given Spurr after it is sent, unless they want to save it!

> What happens when you save it?

Saving Spurrs adds them to YOUR collection so that you can go back and view it whenever you want!

> I sent something bad, like illegal bad, can it be traced back to me?

Nope! We don't store who, when, or where the Spurr comes from, unless you want us to!
